🧮 Scientific Calculator

A modern, responsive Scientific Calculator built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.
This project replicates the core functions of a physical scientific calculator, with an intuitive design and real-time computations.

🚀 Features

Basic Operations – Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

Scientific Functions –  exponential, logarithmic, square root, and power functions

Keyboard Support – Allows input through both on-screen buttons and keyboard keys

Responsive UI – Fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS for seamless use on mobile and desktop

Error Handling – Displays syntax errors and invalid operations gracefully

Dark/Light Mode (optional) – Tailwind-powered theme toggle for enhanced user experience

🛠️ Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
HTML5	Structure and layout of the calculator
Tailwind CSS	Utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive design
JavaScript (ES6)	Logic for calculations, event handling, and UI interactivity
📂 Project Structure
scientific-calculator/
├── index.html
├── style.css        # (optional custom styles)
├── script.js        # main JS logic
└── README.md


💡 Future Enhancements

Add calculation history with localStorage

Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)

Add unit conversion features

Introduce voice command input using Web Speech API

🧠 Learning Outcomes

Understanding DOM manipulation in JavaScript

Applying Tailwind CSS utilities for layout and styling

Managing calculator logic and event-driven programming

Enhancing UI/UX design for technical interfaces
